					To put it simply, these are just my notes. Well, <a href="/notes/evergreen-notes">Evergreen notes</a> to be exact. These notes are not written for others to understand; it is written solely for myself, so if you don't understand something, that's normal. Feel free to navigate through my pensieve.
