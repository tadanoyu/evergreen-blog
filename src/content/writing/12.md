# 📍 Living 

It's been little less than a year since I moved to <u>Orange County</u>.
It was probably one of the best move I made last year.
No more 90~120 minutes of commute, one-way Σ(°ロ°). It's a major quality of life update.

# 🧳 Working

Still working as a <u>validation engineer</u> but _Engineer II_ now (ヽ(*・ω・)ﾉ)
