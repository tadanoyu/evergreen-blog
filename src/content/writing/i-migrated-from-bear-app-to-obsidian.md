Bear app is a cool note app. I've used it for about a year, I think.

It has all the features I needed to build my second brain: wiki style linking, in-out linking, automatic updating linked notes, markdown, syntax highlighting for scripts, and more that is super useful.

It's actually pretty limited compare to other note apps but it was enough.

But the one thing that I really don't like about the bear app is how it store my notes. It seems like they use their own database and it's really not that comfortable when you want to move your note to other system. If you want back up your note, you have to individually export notes to designated directory. Yes, you can select all and export but this little step creates the friction and it gets annoying. I guess this is why people pay for the bear app which provides the 'Sync' option.

I could've chosen the paying option of course, but at least for now, I don't see the benefit of buying subscription just for the sync, when I can simply migrate to other note app that does support one _or simulate it using the iCloud or github repository_.

Anyway, so I migrated _back_ to Obsidian.
