I was born in Korea and immigrated to the States when I was around 10. English is not my first language.

The grammar was never meant to be my friend. I hated it. I was a bit shy to speak and write because I didn't wanted show that my English was bad.

But as I grow, I started care less about the grammar itself. I realized that what's important are expressing my idea in my own words, and people don't expect people to speak in perfect grammar and advanced vocabularies. So I started expressing myself with broken English with confidence.

Now, Chat GPT came out. Ever since this demonic tool came out, I started relying on it. Before I post anything in English in my blog or even in SNS, I found myself utilizing Chat GPT to perfect my grammar and even use vocabularies that I normally don't use. 

There's no "I" in those sentences. It's not me. I'm back to younger version of me who's afraid of exposing my bad English.

I need to stop relying on the machine, especially when I want to talk about my own experience.
