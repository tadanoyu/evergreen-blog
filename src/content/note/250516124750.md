In a linked list, each node contains a *data* and a *pointer* to reference the next or previous node.
Because of the *pointer*, a linked list tends to take up more memory than the array with a same size.

When we have 32-bits integer type array with five elements, it will allocate **20 bytes** of memory (4 bytes * 5).

For the same number of elements, a linked list will need an extra **40 to 60 bytes** of memory just for the pointer; the size of the pointer differs by the OS (32-bits vs. 64-bits).

If we're using a doubly linked list which has an extra pointer, it will consume even more memory.
