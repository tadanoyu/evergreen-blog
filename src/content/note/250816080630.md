**Stack** is a linear data structure where elements can only be added or removed from one end. Because of this structure, the last item you insert is the first one removed. 

Think of a stack of plates to wash. Naturally, you will grab the top one and clean it, one by one. This is Stack and we say it follows *LIFO* (Last-In, First-Out).

스택의 기본 함수와 각 함수의 시간복잡도는 아래와 같다.
- insert -> O(1)
- delete -> O(1)
- access top element -> O(1)
- random access -> O(n)


**Queue** is another linear data structure where insertion happens at one end, but deletion happens in the other end.

Think of people lining up waiting to pay for their groceries in a market. If you're the first one in the line, you'll pay for your groceries first. That's Queue; first come, first served. But instead, we say *FIFO* (First-In, First-Out).
