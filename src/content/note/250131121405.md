In programming languages like C and C++, you need to manually allocate and deallocate memory. Ruby, however, has a convenient memory management system where you don't have to explicitly allocate nor deallocate the memory (there are many other languages with a garbage collector, Ruby is just one of them). 

I created a simple `Person` class that takes two parameters: `name` and `age`.

As you can see, I'm repeatedly creating a new person object (`Person.new`) inside the loop, but I'm not deleting the object nor deallocating any memory. Will it cause memory leak? No.

```rb
class Person
	def initialize(name, age)
		@name = name
		@age = age
	end

	def to_s
		puts "Name: #{@name}  Age: #{@age}"
	end
end

10.times do |i|
	person = Person.new("madelen#{i}", 17 + i.to_i)
	person.to_s
end
```

Ruby's garbage collector will monitor and reclaim any unused memory automatically. For example, when we assign a _new object_ to `person` variable, the previously assigned object will be removed and the memory allocated for that object will be reclaimed automatically since it's no longer reachable.
