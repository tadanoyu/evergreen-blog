‘Omiyage’ means a gift or souvenir in Japanese (it can also mean something negative depends on the situation. [The meaning can change depending on the context](/note/the-meaning-can-change-depending-on-the-context)). This song was written in 2004 by Shoji Kameda as a gift to the taiko community.

When I think of the ‘wave’ section in Omiyage, it reminds me of a 4x100 relay.
Not the relay itself but the scene where a runner passes the baton.

You don’t pass the baton to the person behind you; you pass it to the next person. The same principle applies to the Wave. Each player is passing their own baton — a compression of their energy, passion, knowledge, kata, and excitement — to the next player. The last player, with everyone’s collective energy, then passes that baton to the invisible 5th player, which, in my opinion, represents the next wave of taiko players and the audience.
