Linked list is a linear data structure where an element, called node, is connected via pointers.

The structure of a node may changed depending on the type of a linked list. For example, a node in singly linked list will have a single pointer called `next`. On the other hand, a node in doubly linked list will have two separate pointers, `next` and `prev`, to allow two-ways traversal.

Here's the pseudocode of a typical node in a linked list.
```text
Node {
	T data;
	Node *next;
}
```

Linked list show good performance with insert and delete since it can be done in constant time, `O(1)`; however, it takes linear time, `O(n)`, for look-up since it doesn't support indexing like an array.

If your emphasis is on search rather than insert and delete, it'd be more benificial to use different data structures like the Hash Table or the Array.
