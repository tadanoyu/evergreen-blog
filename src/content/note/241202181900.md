In both [singly linked lists](/note/241113121417) and [doubly linked lists](/note/241114123800), we can determine the last node by looking at its `next` pointer; a node that points to the `NULL` is the last node. In Circular linked list however, there isn't a node that points to `NULL` unless the list itself is empty.

Circular linked list is a list that has no end to it. When you reach the last node, it wraps around back to the head node allowing you to traverse the list from the beginning again.

```text
   head         last                 
---------     ---------
| nodeA | --> | nodeB | --> head --> last --> ....
---------     ---------
```

You can use either singly or doubly linked list to implement a circular linked list. If you need to support backward navigation, you can implement it with doubly linked list as a base. If need forward navigation only, then use singly linked list.
