Linked list is a singular data structure consist of nodes which is a unit we used to refer to an element in a list. Unlike an array where all elements are contiguously aligned in the memory, nodes are dispersed.

To iterate nodes that arenâ€™t adjacent to each other, we need to know nodes' addresses. A typical node holds two attributes: a data and a pointer to the next node.

```c
struct Node {
	int data;
	struct Node *next;
};
```
