A linked list is a linear data structure composed of nodes. Each node represents a single piece of data, similar to an element in an array. However, unlike arrays—where elements are stored contiguously in memory—nodes in a linked list are scattered across memory and connected through pointers.

To traverse a list where nodes are not stored sequentially, we need to keep track of their memory addresses. A typical node consists of two attributes:

- data – the actual value stored in the node.
- pointer – a reference to the next node in the list.

Here's the basic structure of a node in C:
```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};
```

The `data` field holds the value assigned to the node (an integer in this case). And the `next` pointer stores the address of the next node, allowing traversal through the list.

Since a linked list relies on pointers for navigation, overriding the next pointer of a node without preserving its original reference can break the chain, making it impossible to access subsequent nodes. This is why proper pointer management is crucial in linked lists ([250204123024](/note/250204123024)).

Here’s a minimal example of a linked list with three nodes (1 -> 2 -> 3):

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Define a Node structure
typedef struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
} Node;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // Allocate memory for the head node and check for NULL
    Node *head = malloc(sizeof(Node));

    // Initialize first node
    head->data = 1;
    head->next = malloc(sizeof(Node));

    // Initialize second node
    head->next->data = 2;
    head->next->next = malloc(sizeof(Node));

    // Initialize third node
    head->next->next->data = 3;
    head->next->next->next = NULL; // End of list

    // Traverse and print the list
    Node *curr = head;
    while (curr) {
        printf("%d\n", curr->data);
        curr = curr->next;
    }

    // Free allocated memory
    curr = head;
    while (curr) {
        Node *temp = curr->next;
        free(curr);
        curr = temp;
    }

    head = NULL; // Avoid dangling pointer

    return 0;
}
```
