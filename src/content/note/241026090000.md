Linked list is a linear data structure consist of nodes. A node refers to a single data in a list, similar to the word _element_ in an array. Unlike an array where all elements are contiguously aligned in the memory, nodes are dispersed.

To iterate nodes that arenâ€™t adjacent to each other, we need to know nodes' addresses. A typical node holds two attributes: a data and a pointer to the next node.

```c
struct Node {
	int data;
	struct Node *next;
};
```

The `data` is a value you assigned to the node which is an integer in this case. And the pointer, `next`, is a reference to the next node which allows you to traverse the list in sequential order. This  means you cannot access any of the nodes connected to the first node if you override its `next` pointer; there's no entry point.

Here's a minimal version of a linked list with three nodes (`1 -> 2 -> 3`).

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct Node {
	int data;
	struct Node *next;
} Node;

int main(int argch, char **argv) {
	Node *head = malloc(sizeof(Node));

	head->data = 1;
	head->next = malloc(sizeof(Node));

	head->next->data = 2;
	head->next->next = malloc(sizeof(Node));

	head->next->next->data = 3;
	head->next->next->next = NULL;

	Node *curr = head;
	while(curr) {
		printf("%d\n", curr->data);
		curr = curr->next;
	}

	curr = head;
	while(curr) {
		Node *temp = curr->next;
		free(curr);
		curr = temp;
	}

	head = NULL;

	return 0;
}
```
