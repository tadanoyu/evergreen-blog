Generally, the index operator (`[]`)  refers to a way of accessing an element from a sequential data in constant time. This __fast random access__ is possible because data are managed in a contiguous memory layout.

Strings for example, the index operator can be used to access specific characters. Then you can simply retrieve the value or even modify the original data ([Ruby strings are mutable objects](/en/note/250711055035-en/)).
```rb
str = "hello"
str[0] # => "H"

str[0] = 'H'
str # => "Hello"
```

Another example would  be an array. When an array is declared, it allocates a block of contiguous memory allowing you to access, retrieve, and/or modify data in constant time.
```c
int arr = {1,1,2,3,4}; // block of memory allocated for 5 ints
arr[0] = 0;
arr // => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

If data are not stored contiguously in memory, index-based constant-time access using the index operator is not possible ([[Hash tables use key-based lookup]]). When data are laid out adjacent to each other, the system can locate any element by calculating an offset from the first element ([[Hash tables don't use offset math]]).
