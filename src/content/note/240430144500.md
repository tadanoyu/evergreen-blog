Previously, people used [git-filter-branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch) to rewrite commit history but it is no longer used or used less as it's [somewhat deprecated as of Git 2.24, Q4 2019](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25720268/git-commands-that-could-break-rewrite-the-history/58251653#58251653). Instead, I can now use [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo?tab=readme-ov-file).

`git filter-repo` is not only faster than the `git filter-branch` but also equipped with more capabilities.

## Installation
- brew
    - Since I'm using macOS, I can use Homebrew to easily install it.
    ```sh
    brew install git-filter-repo
    ```
    - After the installation, I can use either `git filter-repo` or `git-filter-repo` with the dash.
- pip
    - Alternatively, I can use `pip` to install the package:
    ```sh
    python3 -m pip install --user git-filter-repo
    ```

Make sure the path to python is added on the path, otherwise I'll need to use absolute path to where it is installed.

```sh
<PATH TO PYTHON>/<VERSION>/bin/git-filter-repo
```
