An array is a type of linear data structure where elements are stored contiguously in the memory. When an array is first initialized, a block of memory will be allocated. 

Let's say we initialized an integer type array with size five. Then your program will allocate 20 bytes of memory (4 bytes * 5 integer type data).

Traditionally, arrays store data that are of same type. This is important otherwise, your program wont know how much of space it needs to allocate for your array.

```c
bool bool_array[5];    // each element is of type 'bool'
int  integer_array[5];
char char_array[5];
float float_array[5];
double double_array[5];

int* int_pointer_array[5]; // each element being int*
Person person_obj_array[5]; // each element is a Person object
```
