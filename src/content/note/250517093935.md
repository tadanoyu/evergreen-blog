In order to traverse data in a linked list, you have to start from the `head` node. You can also start from the `tail` node if you implemented a doubly linked list (backward traversal).

In other words, if you mistakenly *nullify* the `head`, you will lose all the access to any other nodes connected to it.

This can potentially cause a memory leak by failing to reclaim all the allocated memories for each node.
