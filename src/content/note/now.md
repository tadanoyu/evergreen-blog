I'm back in California, working as a Validation Engineer (although my job title says I'm a Network Engineer) at 〇〇〇.


## what I'm doing now
- learning data strutures using Ruby
- avoiding sns - deleted all sns from my phone to avoid wasting time on it

## what I'm NOT trying to do now
- lying on bed during the daytime
- wasting time on ig, x, youtube, reels, shorts, etc..
- doing stupid things - there are some stupid things that I'm doing, that I know are stupid and wrong, that I could stop doing, and that I would stop doing.

## things I'm currently into

- programming Lanuage: **Ruby**
- podcasts: [ごはんとみそしる](https://open.spotify.com/show/46J6Jruc0YVEdlvth5qEXq?si=3f743db59d074ce0)
