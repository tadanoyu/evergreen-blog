A data structure is used to layout your data in certain order so that you can easily access, modify, delete, and/or analyze the data.

There is no one perfect data structure that fits all the use cases. One data structure may show better performances in one case, and the other data structure in other cases. For example, _arrays_ fit better for your app if it requires many look up operations ([250203120334](/note/250203120334)).

On the other hand, if insertions or deletions are used lot more than the look up, _linked lists_ will show better performance. You can also consider using _hash tables_ for better look up, insertion, and deletion by sacrificing some memory for the space usage. There are many more data structures for different use cases.

You don't have to study every one of them now, but at least know what is out there. And when you encounter certain use cases where different data structure is needed, go study it.

The more you know, the more creative you can be.
