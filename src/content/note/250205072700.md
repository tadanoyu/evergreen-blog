There are many ways to implement a linked list, but its classification depends on its structural characteristics.

Linked lists have three broad categories:

- [Singly Linked List](/note/241113121417) _(one-way traversal)_
- [Doubly Linked List](/note/241114123800) _(two-way traversal)_
- [Circular Linked List](/note/241202181900) _(last node links back to the first)_

Most linked lists share fundamental operations, but their structure affects efficiency and capabilities. For example, doubly linked lists enable O(1) backward traversal, unlike singly linked lists.
