Both non-empty [singly linked list](/en/note/250721125422-en/) and [doubly linked list](/en/note/250722115213-en/) have a terminating point which is defined by a node pointing to the null (`head.prev == nil` or `tail.next == nil`).

In circular linked list, however, there's no node where it points to the null. If implemented with a singly linked list, the last node, `tail`, will point back to `head`. If doubly linked list was used as a base of a circular linked list, `head.prev` will point to the `tail` and `tail.next` will point to the `head` creating a circular, endless list.
