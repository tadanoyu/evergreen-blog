A static array is an array that is created at compile-time. Because it's created at compile-time, you must know the size of the array beforehand. Once the static array is created, the sized will be  fixed and it cannot be re-scaled.

If an array of size seven is given, you can only add 7 elements to that array. You can also modify it or delete it by assigning a `null` value, but you cannot alter the container size, which is 7.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	const int SIZE = 7;
	int arr[SIZE] = {0}; // {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}

	arr[0] = 1;
	arr[6] = 7;

	printf("1st element: %d\n", arr[0]); // 1
	printf("7th element: %d\n", arr[6]); // 7

	arr[0] *= 10;
	arr[6] *= 10;

	printf("1st element: %d\n", arr[0]); // 10
	printf("7th element: %d\n", arr[6]); // 70

	arr[0] = '\0';
	
	printf("1st element: %d\n", arr[0]); // null
	return 0;
}
```

A dynamic array is created at run-time. This means you can create an array without knowing the size. The size of a dynamic array is not fixed and can be re-scaled at any time, as large as your memory can handle without crashing it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	int size = 0;

	// get the array size from the user
	printf("enter the array size: ");
	scanf("%d", &size);

	// create an array by allocating memory to hold 'size' elements
	int *arr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * size);

	arr[0]      = 1;
	arr[size-1] = size;

	printf("1st element: %d\n", arr[0]);
	printf("last element: %d\n", arr[size-1]);

	// re-scale the array by getting a new size
	printf("Re-enter the array size: ");
	scanf("%d", &size);

	// re-allocate
	arr = realloc(arr, sizeof(int) * size);

	arr[size-1] = size;

	printf("1st element: %d\n", arr[0]);
	printf("last element: %d\n", arr[size-1]);

	// deallocate array
	free(arr);

	return 0;
}
```

([250130081822](/note/250130081822)) One important thing about dynamic array is that you need to deallocate all the memory you've allocated before exiting the program.
