A data structure is used to layout your data in certain order so that you can easily access, modify, delete, and/or analyze the data.

There is no one perfect data structure that fits all the use cases. One data structure may show better performances in one case, and the other data structure in other cases. For example, [Array](/note/what-is-an-array) fits better for your app if it requires many look up operations. On the other hand, if insertions or deletions are used lot more than the look up, [Linked Lists](/note/what-is-a-linked-list) will show better performance. Or you can consider using a [Hash Table](/note/what-is-a-hash-table) for better look up, insertion, and deletion by sacrificing some memory for the space usage.
