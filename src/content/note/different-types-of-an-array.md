There are three different types of an array: [Static Array](/note/static-array), [Dynamic Array](/note/dynamic-array), and [Jagged Array](/note/jagged-array).

Static array is created at compile time while both dynamic and jagged arrays are created during runtime. You can create multi-dimension arrays using any of the three arrays, but if you want to create an array of arrays with each array being _different sizes_, use jagged array.
