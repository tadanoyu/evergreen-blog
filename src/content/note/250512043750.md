If you need to repeatedly perform insert and/or delete operations, the array should not be the choice of your data structure, because it is slow.
The reason why insertion and deletion are slow is because of the *shifting*.

When you insert an element, you must shift all the elements to the right to create a space for that new element to be inserted, `O(n)`.

Insertion example:

```text
# insert 3 at index 3

[0][1][2][4][5][_]  # original

[0][1][2][_][4][5]  # shift every elements from index 3
[0][1][2][3][4][5]
```

Deletion example:

```text
# delete index 3
[0][1][2][3][4][5] # original

[0][1][2][_][4][5] # index 3 removed; shift everything to fill in the gap
[0][1][2][4][5][_]
```

The only exception would be inserting at the end of the array, `Î©(1)`.
