The main difference between a doubly linked list and a [singly linked list](/note/241113121417) is that the nodes in doubly linked lists hold two references: the next node and the previous node. This makes the list traversable in two directions.

```text
           head                         tail
         ---------     ---------     ---------
NULL <-- | nodeA | <-> | nodeB | <-> | nodeC | --> NULL
         ---------     ---------     ---------
```

Since the basic structure are the same between single and doubly linked list, they share majority of the methods such as `insert`, `remove`, `cat`, etc...

Although they share same methods, the implementation will change slightly since doubly linked list can link to the preceding node as well. Here are couple methods where implementation will change:
- `insert(item)`
- `pop_back`
- `pop_front`
- `remove(item)`
- `cat(list)` - catenate two lists together

Since doubly linked list can traverse backward, we can utilize this to implement more useful methods:
- `find_last(value)` - get the last node that holds `value`
- `display(reverse=false)` - print the contents in reverse order if `reverse` is `true`
