When declaring an array, you can create a static array if size of the data is known beforehand ([240611103553](/note/240611103553)); however, in most cases, that is not the case especially when dealing with a real data.

You do not have to know the size beforehand when creating dynamic arrays. You can get the total number of data from a file or even from a user at runtime and allocate enough memory to store that amount of data. So, the size is not fixed and it can be re-scaled or resized.

Using a dynamic array seems better choice than static arrays ([250130073757](/note/250130073757)), but there's one caveat. When you allocate memory, you must deallocate and reclaim all the memory explicitly ([250130081822](/note/250130081822)). If your program continues to allocate new memory without re-claiming the old ones, it can cause memory leak and eventually degrade the performance.

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	// allocate memory to store 7 int-type elements
	int *arr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * 7);

	arr[0] = 1;
	arr[6] = 7;

	// arr[0]: 1   arr[6]: 7
	printf("arr[0]: %d    arr[6]: %d\n", *arr, arr[6]);

	// deallocate memory
	free(arr);

    // arr[0]: <trash vaule>  arr[6]: <trash value>
	printf("arr[0]: %d    arr[6]: %d\n", *arr, arr[6]);

	return 0;
}
```
