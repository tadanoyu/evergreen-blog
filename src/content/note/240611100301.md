Generally speaking, there are three types of arrays: [Static Array](/note/240611103553), Dynamic Array, and Jagged Array.

([250130073757](/note/250130073757)) The distinction between static and dynamic arrays lies in how and when memory is allocated. Memory for static arrays is allocated at compile-time, whereas memory for dynamic arrays is allocated at runtime. Either type can be used to create a multi-dimensional array (e.g., 2×4, 3×3, 1×3, etc.).

A jagged array is a type of multi-dimensional array where each element (itself an array) can have a different length, resulting in an irregular or _jagged_ structure.
