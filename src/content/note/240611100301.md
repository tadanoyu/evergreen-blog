Generally speaking, there are three different types of arrays: [Static Array](/note/240611103553), Dynamic Array, and Jagged Array.

([250130073757](/note/250130073757)) The _static_ and _dynamic_ arrays are determined by how and when memory is allocated. A memory is allocated at compile-time for static arrays and at runtime for dynamic arrays. Either of it can be used to create a multi-dimensional array (e.g. 2x4, 3x3, 1x3, etc ...)

A jagged array is a form of multi-dimensional array where each element (an array) can have a different length, creating a structure with a jagged or spiky end.
