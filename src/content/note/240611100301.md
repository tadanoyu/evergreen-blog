Arrays can be categorized into two different types: *Static* and *Dynamic*.
The difference comes from how and where memory are stored.

For the static array, memories are allocated in the stack at compile time.

```c
int arr[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
```

On the other hand, memories are allocated at the heap in runtime for the dynamic array.

```c
const int SIZE = 5;
int *arr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * SIZE);

for(int i=0; i<SIZE; ++i) {
    arr[i] = i;
}

free(arr);
```

Notice that we have to manually **allocate** and **deallocate** memories. Not all languages have a garbage collector.
