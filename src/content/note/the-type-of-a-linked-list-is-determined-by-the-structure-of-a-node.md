The only difference between different types of linked lists are really just the structure of a node with exception to a circular linked list.

Singly Linked list is a linked list where each node can only traverse through one way. So the node will only worry about locating the _next_ node.
```rb
class SinglyLinkedList
	class Node
		def initialize(data, next=nil)
			@data = data
		end
	end
end
```

Doubly linked list is same as the singly except that it can traverse in both ways.
```rb
class DoublyLinkedList
	class Node
		def initialize(data, prev=nil, next=nil)
			@data = data
		end
	end
end
```

Circular linked list is a linked list that has no end unless the list itself is empty. Meaning, you can traverse the list infinitely if you want to, as long as thereâ€™s one or more nodes.
Circular linked list can be either singly or doubly linked list. So the node structure will be same based on which linked list you use as a base.

To create a circular linked list, you simply need to make the last node in the list to point back to the first node. So if a list only has a single node, it will point back to itself creating a loop..
```rb
class CircularLinkedList
	attr_accessor :head

	class Node
		def initialize(data, next=nil)
			@data = data
		end
	end

	def push_back(data)
		# if list is empty
		if @head.nil?
			# create a new node
			@head = Node.new(data)
			# last node (head) points to the first node (head)
			@head.next = @head
		else
			# ... more code
		end
	end
end
```
