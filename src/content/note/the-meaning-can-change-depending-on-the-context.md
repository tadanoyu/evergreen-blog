A simple phrase like ‘I have a gift for you’ can mean two very different things in two different contexts.

In a regular context, it literally means that someone has a gift for another person. In a dark, noir, or horror context, a ‘gift’ could imply something negative, shocking, or even a threatening surprise.

The context in which the phrase is used significantly influences its interpretation, illustrating how the same words can convey very different meanings.
