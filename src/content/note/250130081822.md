When using dynamic arrays in languages like C or C++, you typically allocate memory using functions like `malloc` or `new`, respectively. If this allocated memory is not explicitly freed using functions like `free` in C or `delete[]` in C++, it remains allocated until the program terminates. This can potentially cause a memory leak, especially in long-running programs where memory usage accumulates over time.

In C, use `free()`:
```c
int *arr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
free(arr); // explicitly freed the memory
```

In C++, use `delete[]`:
```cpp
int *arr = new int[10];
delete[] arr; // explicitly freed the memory
```

There are other programming languages that does this job for you automatically. In that case, you do not need to explicitly free the memory since garbage collectors do it for you.
