When using [dynamic arrays](/note/250101052312) in languages like C or C++, you typically allocate memory using functions like `malloc` or `new`, respectively. If this allocated memory is not explicitly freed, it remains allocated until the program terminates. This can potentially cause a memory leak, especially in long-running programs where memory usage accumulates over time.

In C, use `free()`:
```c
int *arr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
free(arr); // explicitly freed the memory
```

In C++, use `delete[]`:
```cpp
int *arr = new int[10];
delete[] arr; // explicitly freed the memory
```

In many other programming languages, memory management is handled automatically by a garbage collector. In such cases, you do not need to manually free memory, as the garbage collector reclaims unused memory for you.
