You are given a linked list with five nodes and you only have an access to the first node like the following.

```c
Node *head = createNode(1);
insertNode(head, 2);
insertNode(head, 3);
insertNode(head, 4);
insertNode(head, 5);
```

You can use the `head` to traverse the whole list.

```c
printAll(head); // 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

What would happen if you accidentally assign a `NULL` to the `head`? 

```c
Node *head = createNode(1);
insertNode(head, 2);
insertNode(head, 3);
insertNode(head, 4);
insertNode(head, 5);

head = NULL;

printAll(head) // < blank >
```

You've just lost an access to all other four nodes in the memory and there's no way to reclaim it. They will stay in the memory throughout the program's life cycle until the program terminates. These pointers are called dangling pointers which will cause a memory leak.
