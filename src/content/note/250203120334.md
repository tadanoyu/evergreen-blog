If your program uses look-up operation far more than insert and delete operations, arrays could be a good option.

You can look-up and/or modify any elements in the array by their indexes using `[]` operator which has a constant time complexity or _O(1)_.

```c
int arr[10] = {0};

// access/modify = O(1)
arr[2] = 7;

// read = O(1)
printf("%d\n", arr[2]);
```

If you need lots of insertions/deletions, you should avoid using arrays. Instead, you can consider using either linked lists or hash tables.
