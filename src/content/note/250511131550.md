When you clone a repository using a SSH key, it prompts you to enter the passphrase. If you're cloning a single repository, this may not be an issue. However, if you're trying to clone multiple repositories, this becomes a troublesome. We can bypass this via configuring SSH auth.

First create a `config` file in `~/.ssh` directory.
```sh
mkdir ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/config
vim ~/.ssh/config
```

Use the SSH currently used in GitHub and register in like the following:
```config
Host github.com
HostName github.com
IdentitiesOnly yes
UseKeychain yes
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

In the case of macOS, add the SSH key to the system keychain as well.
```sh
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Add GitHub's server host key to the `known_hosts`.
```sh
ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

Confirm SSH key auth is working properly.
```sh
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Setting is complete if you see a message like the below:

```txt
Hi tadanoyu! You've successfully authenticated, 
but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Once the setup is complete, it won't ask for the passphrase when you clone a repository using SSH key.
