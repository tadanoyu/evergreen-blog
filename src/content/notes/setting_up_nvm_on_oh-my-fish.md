Setting up node in [oh-my-fish](/notes/oh_my_fish) requires a bit of configuration than simply installing it.

## Install NVM package
```bash
omf install nvm
```

## Set the NVM directory:
```bash
set -gx NVM_DIR (brew --prefix nvm)
```

## Install the NVM plugin for Fisher. 
```bash
fisher install jorgebucaran/nvm.fish
```

If you don't have `fisher`, you can install it using `brew install fisher`:

## Install and use Node
```bash
nvm install latest
nvm use latest
set --universal nvm_default_version latest
```

You may want to remove the conflicting Node versions:

```bash
which -a node
...
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/node
```
