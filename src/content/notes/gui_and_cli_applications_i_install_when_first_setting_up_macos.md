These are applications I first install when I set up a fresh mac. I'm use [Homebrew](/notes/homebrew) to make installation quick and easy.

## GUI Applications 
```bash
brew install --cask \
	bitwarden \
	figma \
	karabiner-elements \
	obsidian \
	rectangle \
	spotify \
	gifski \
	obs \
	kitty
```

Install [Bear](https://bear.app/) note app manually since it's not listed in homebrew.

## CLI Applications
```bash
brew install \
	bat \
	curl \
	fish \ # used for oh-my-fish
	fisher \
	git \
	git-lfs \
	gh \ # github CLI
	gpg \
	pinentry-mac \
	nvm \
	pnpm \
	neovim \
	tmux \
	ripgrep \ # used for telescope.nvim
	fd \ # used for telescope.nvim
```
