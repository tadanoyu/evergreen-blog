Frictionless sounds like there was no thinking. In that sense, the question changes to _"should you not think when writing notes?"_

If your goal is to _collect_ the information so that you can refer back to it later, then it makes sense. For example, you're in a college classroom and your professor is lecturing about C++. You may take notes without thinking and look back later to understand what you wrote.

This all makes sense for _transient_ type of notes like fleeting notes. But if it's for [evergreen notes](/notes/evergreen_notes) where each note contains one thought written in your own words, then absolutely no. You need a considerable amount of friction to create a quality note.
