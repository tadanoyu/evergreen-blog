Miracle Morning is not about waking up early at 4 or 5 AM. It doesn't prescribe a specific wake-up time; instead, it's more of a ritual designed to help you start your day with a purpose. With that being said, yes, even night owls can adopt the Miracle Morning routine and benefit from it.

Regardless of your usual waking time, try to get up a little earlier (e.g., 5-30 minutes) and establish your morning ritual or routine. The Miracle Morning introduces a routine called SAVERS routine, but you're not obligated to follow it. Experiment with your mornings; create your own routine that helps you start the day strong.
