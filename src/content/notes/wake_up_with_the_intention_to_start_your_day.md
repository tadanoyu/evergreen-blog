Do you wake up in the morning with the intention to start your day? For most people, the answer is no.

When the alarm rings, you hit the snooze button, sleep in. The alarm rings again, you hit snooze again. Repeat this a couple of times, and finally, you wake up feeling groggy. You wash up, grab whatever clothes from the closet, and leave to make it to your class, work, or wherever you need to be. Forget about the alarm; maybe your parent wakes you up for breakfast. Either way, this is a sign that you're starting your morning very unintentionally.

The morning version of you should depict the best version of yourself throughout the entire day â€” full of energy and in the greatest state physically, mentally, and spiritually. So why waste this opportunity?

Wake up with the intention to start the day strong.
