There are three (_maybe more?_) different types of an array: [Static Array](/notes/static_array), [[Dynamic Array]], and [[Jagged Array]].

Static array is created at compile time while both dynamic and jagged arrays are created during runtime. You can create multi-dimension arrays using any of the three arrays, but if you want to create an array of arrays with each array being _different sizes_, use jagged array.
