When you start learning a new language, the best way to improve is by using it. Ignore the syntax, the grammar, vocabs, just let it out. But this isn't so easy because we're afraid of making mistakes; this is especially true if you're either an introvert or a perfectionist. 

It's hard for an introvert because you don't want to feel shame by making a mistake. "what if the grammar is wrong here?", "what if they think I'm an idiot?", "what if...", and so on. You care too much about other eyes.

For a perfectionist, you don't want to expose yourself when you're not ready. But when are you ready? 

Confidence is the key in improving the language skill. As a language learner, It's just a fact that you don't know much about the language. You will and have to make a mistake to learn it. If you're afraid of failure, you'll never overcome it.
