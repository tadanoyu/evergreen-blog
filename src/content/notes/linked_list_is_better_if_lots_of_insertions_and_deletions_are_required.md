[[Linked lists|Linked List]] is a linear data structure where nodes are connected via pointers. A node is an element used in a linked list ([[Different linked lists have different node structures]]).

By the nature of pointers, it is more efficient to insert and delete data in a linked list because the only operation required is changing the value of the node's pointer (so that it points to the other node or `nil` if deleting). This operation is O(1).

Because of this reason, when your project requires lots of insertion and/or deletions of data, linked list is one way to go for it. You can also consider using a hash map if look up is important. [[Linked list is slow in look up]] because it requires a linear time complexity.
