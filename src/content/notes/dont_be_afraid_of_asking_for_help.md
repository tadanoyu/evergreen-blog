People tend to shy away when it comes to asking for help because we fear speaking up in public and talking to strangers. We also tend to think about negative responses, such as "What if he/she says no?" and try to avoid creating that situation, which ends up preventing us from asking for help.

However, asking implies that there are two possible answers: yes and no. You shouldn't expect everyone to say yes to your request, which is perfectly normal. Thus, you shouldn't feel down if you receive negatives. Simply look for another person who might be able to do a favor for you.

Don't complain if nobody notices you and don't get upset because nobody helped you. [Help is not an obligation; it's just an act of kindness](/notes/help_is_not_an_obligation_its_just_an_act_of_kindness).
