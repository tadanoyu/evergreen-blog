You can use `scale` option in the code to increase the resolution.

```js
html2canvas(el, {
  scale: 2,
  onrendered: myRenderFunction
})
```

`scale` defaults to `window.devicePixelRatio`. This means, if we set `window.devicePixelRatio = 2` before the call to `html2canvas`, it'll to do the same job as scaling it to `2`.
