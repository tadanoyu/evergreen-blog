You cannot treat someone's kindness as if they 'have' to help you. 

If you are in trouble and there is a person who realizes it and proactively helps you even before you ask for help, that's great. You can appreciate their kindness and move on. But just because nobody helped you when you never asked for it, you cannot be mad at anyone, except maybe yourself for not being brave enough to ask for help ([Don't be afraid of asking for help](/notes/dont_be_afraid_of_asking_for_help)). 

Anyone can decide to offer assistance to anyone at their own will. Help is not an obligation; it's just an act of kindness.
