<!-- > 아, 비행기 내릴 때 오버헤드빈에서 짐 내리는데도... 멀뚱멀뚱 쳐다보기만 함. 머리에 올려서 겨우 짐 내렸다. 오버헤드빈을 쳐다만 봐도 도와주겠다고 나서준 사람들(대부분 남자들)이 많았던 그동안의 수많은 비행들이 스쳐지나가며... 왜 내 조국은..ㅠ 왜 한국 남자들은... -->

You cannot treat someone's kindness as if they 'have' to help you. If you are in trouble and there is a person who realizes it and proactively helps you even before you ask for help, that's great. You can appreciate their kindness and move on. But just because nobody helped you when you never asked for it, you cannot be mad at anyone, except maybe yourself for not being brave enough to ask for help ([Don't be afraid of asking for help](/notes/dont_be_afraid_of_asking_for_help)). Anyone can decide to offer assistance to anyone at their own will. Help is not an obligation; it's just an act of kindness.
