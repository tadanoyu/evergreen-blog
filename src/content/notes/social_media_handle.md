A social media handle is a public username that represents people on social media websites.

역시 `rolemadelen`만 한게 없다.

## 2024-04-26
Decided to change my handle to `img9417`. The `img` is from "I'm Jii" and numbers represent the year I was born and my favorite number.

## 2023
I don't exactly recall the date but I once changed my handle to `bepersistent` and came back to `rolemadelen`.

## 2022-08-05
My handle `rolemadelen` is derived from the term _role model_. My friend modified this term and called me _role madeline_. The moment I saw this, I fell in love with how it sounds and decided to use it as my handle. I just changed the feminine name to more masculine or neutral spelling and it became _role madelen_.
