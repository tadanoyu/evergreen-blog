To achieve a more efficient [[primality test]] algorithm, we can limit our checks to numbers up to the square root of `n`.

If `n` is not a prime number, it can be represented as a product of two factors, `p` and `q`. At least one of these factors will be less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

```ts
const isPrime = (n: number): boolean => {
  if (n === 2) return true
  if (n % 2 === 0) return false
  const UPPER_BOUND = Math.sqrt(n)

  for (let i = 3; i <= UPPER_BOUND; i += 2) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      return false
    }
  }

  return true
}
```

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(sqrt(N))`. We can further optimize the algorithm by leveraging the properties of `6K-1` and `6K+1` ([[6k Â± 1 Optimization]]).
