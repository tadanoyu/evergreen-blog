An array is a type of linear [Data Structure](/notes/data_structure) where elements are stored contiguously in the memory. This means a chunk or a block of memory is allocated when the array is first initialized ãƒ¼ there are [Different types of an array](/notes/different_types_of_an_array).

The traditional type of an array store elements that of a same type. For example, you can have an array of integers, an array of strings, an array of objects, and etc... Not all arrays are implemented this way. Arrays in other languages are more like an object, a linked list , a vector, a dynamic array, or a hash table.

For example in JavaScript, arrays are more like objects, an array-like. Indexes are keys (integers). Because of this feature, [You can add properties in JavaScript arrays](/notes/you_can_add_properties_in_javascript_arrays).

Arrays in Python and Ruby are also little different than the traditional array. They can hold different types and resize dynamically. But they don't allow creating arbitrary properties like in JavaScript.
