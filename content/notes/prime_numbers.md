A prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself without resulting in a fraction or decimal. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29 are the first ten prime numbers. Among them, 2 is the only even prime number. [[Primality test]] is an algorithm to determine whether an input number is prime.
