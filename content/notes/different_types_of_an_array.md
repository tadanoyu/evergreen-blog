# Different types of an array
#evergreen

There are three (==maybe more?==) different types of an array: [[Static Array]], [[Dynamic Array]], and [[Jagged Array]].

Static array is created at compile time while both dynamic and jagged arrays are created during runtime. You can create multi-dimension arrays using any of the three arrays, but if you want to create an array of arrays with each array being _different sizes_, use jagged array.
