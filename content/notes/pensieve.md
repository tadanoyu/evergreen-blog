Hi. I'm [Jii Yoo](https://blog.jiiyoo.me/about). You've found my [Pensieve](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve).

> "I use the Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form."  ー Albus Dumbledore explaining his Pensieve to Harry Potter

To put it simply, these are just my notes. Well, [[Evergreen notes]] to be exact. These notes are not written for others to understand; it is written solely for myself, so if you don't understand something, that's normal. Feel free to navigate through my pensieve.

In order to navigate it, you'll need some starting points. You can start with my [[now page]] or here are some other entry points:
- [[Git]]
- [[Dev]]
- [[Journal]]
