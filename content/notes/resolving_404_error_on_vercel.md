Add the following to the `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
    "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
}
```

After deploying my side project, YourTrack, on Vercel, at first, it seemed to be working fine because it successfully loaded the authentication page to connect with Spotify.

However, once I agreed to connect and the page reloaded to return to the preview flow, I encountered a 404 NOT FOUND error.

Initially, I thought it was a configuration error with Vite and React, but it turns out that it wasn't. It was actually quite simple.

I had to add a configuration file for Vercel so that when my page reloads or goes to a different route, it doesn't show a 404 page.

Add the following to the `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
    "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
}
```

Re-deploy your app, and it should work fine.
