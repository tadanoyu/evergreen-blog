Permanent note is permanent in a sense that it _permanently resides in your system_ rather than the content being immutable.

//

It is possible to get misled by the term _permanent_ when you're just starting zettelkasten. Permanent notes are not immutable contents where you cannot change what you previously wrote. As long as you keep the _thought_ as it is because you don't want to break the link between any other notes referring to this note, you can change or improve the wordings, add more comments, or references. These notes are permanent in a sense that it can be permanently helpful to you.
