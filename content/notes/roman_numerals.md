Roman numerals are numbers represented by series of specific symbols. 

//

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

- `I`:  `1`
- `V`:  `5`
- `X`:  `10`
- `L`:  `50`
- `C`:  `100`
- `D`:  `500`
- `M`:  `1000`

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 
`12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. 
The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

There are six instances where subtraction is used to represent numbers like 4, 9, 40, etc...

- `IV`: `4`
- `IX`: `9`
- `XL`: `40`
- `XC`: `90`
- `CD`: `400`
- `CM`: `900`

For example, `49` is written as `XLIX`. `14` is written as `XIV`.
