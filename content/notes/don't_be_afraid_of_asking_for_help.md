> "어제 공항에 도착해서 '아.. 내가 한국에 왔구나'를 절절히 느낀 순간: 수하물 찾는 곳에서 내 주위로 건장한 남자들이 많았지만 만삭의 내가 컨베이어벨트에서 6개의 짐을 낑낑거리며 내리는 동안 단.한.명.도 도와주지 않았다." 

People tend to shy away when it comes to asking for help because we fear speaking up in public and talking to strangers. We also tend to think about negative responses, such as "What if he/she says no?" and try to avoid creating that situation, which ends up preventing us from asking for help.

However, asking implies that there are two possible answers: yes and no. You shouldn't expect everyone to say yes to your request, which is perfectly normal. Thus, you shouldn't feel down if you receive negatives. Simply look for another person who might be able to do a favor for you.

Don't complain if nobody notices you and don't get upset because nobody helped you. [[Help is not an obligation; it's just an act of kindness]].
