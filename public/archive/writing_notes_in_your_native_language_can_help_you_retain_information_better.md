Because English is the current lingua franca, the content you find on the web is most likely to be in English. If you limit yourself to write notes in your language only, this will prevent you from copying-and-pasting and summarizing someone else's words. By forcing you to translate the thoughts and ideas, you will spend reasonable time with the content you just consumed to fully understand and write it in your own words. 

This gives enough friction in your note-taking process which helps you to create your own version of the content you consumed ([should note-taking be frictionless?](/notes/should_note-taking_be_frictionless)).
