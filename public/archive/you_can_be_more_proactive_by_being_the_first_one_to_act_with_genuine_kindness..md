You don't have to wait until you receive kindness. Instead, you can be more proactive by being the first one to act with genuine kindness.

You don't have to be eavesdropping everywhere, but you can be the first one to listen, to seek understanding, and to offer assistance. 

But most importantly, don't expect a returned kindness.
