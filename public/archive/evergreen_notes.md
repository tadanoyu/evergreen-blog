The evergreen note is a note-writing system that is not about _writing_ notes, but about _expanding_ your knowledge through creating, organizing, developing, and accumulating everlasting notes.

Evergreen notes constitute these five principles:
1. Evergreen notes should be atomic
2. Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented
3. Evergreen notes should be densely-linked
4. Evergreen notes should be unlabeled (non-hierarchical)
5. Evergreen notes should be written for yourself by default, not for an audience

These concepts are similar to those used in Zettelkasten system because it was originally derived from it by [Andy Matuschak](/notes/andy_matuschak).
